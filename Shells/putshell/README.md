# PUTshell


This is my test readme file.

## Importing the shell

Import the shell as you would any other 2G shell, from the **Shells** management page.

## Creating the resource

In the **Inventory** dashboard, create a new resource using the **Putshell** shell. Provide a name and any IP address value, and click **Create**. Then click **Continue**.
